# Message Encoder

## About

Message Encoder is a program that encrypts your message into ciphertext, which is almost impossible to decipher without the aid of a computer. Message Encoder takes your inputted text, and, through 4 advanced methods, decrypts it back into the encoded message accurately.

There is a `Python(.py)` and `C++(.cpp)` version of Message Encoder. Since they work in the same way, it is possible to encrypt using the Python program and decrypt using the C++ program with the program still working.
