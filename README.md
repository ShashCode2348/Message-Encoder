# Message-Encoder
Message Encoder is a Python prgram that encrypts your message into ciphertext almost imposiible to decipher without the program through 4 advanced methods, and decrypts it back into the encoded message accurately.

There is a Python(.py) and C++(.cpp) version of Message Encoder. As they use the same logic, it is possible to encrypt using the Python program and decrypt using the C++ program with the program still working.
